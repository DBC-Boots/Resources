# Resource Guide for DBC Graduates

Welcome ye all who have found the Post-DBC Resources guide. This section are resources to get you started for your Post-DBC life. We're using the Wiki instead of contributing to the Repository. That way, anyone who joins can make changes without having to do commits (we're not official here).

For full access, check out the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/DBC-Boots/Resources/wiki).

The Wiki is divided into subsections.

> @channel: spitballin’ ideas here, but have we thought about creating a github repo from DBC alums for DBC alums, which talks about different categories relevant to devs post-graduation? Or has this already been done?

> Topics of interest: Hiring, Speaking, Organising Meetups, Dev Interviews, Networking, Mentee & Mentors.

> I imagine it’d start out really loosely and then as it grows it can move around and be re-structured. It seems like there’s a lot of space here for a publicly created "DBC alum accredited” resource like this to bring more people into the DBC fold and also help everyone.

> Like a style guide

Hence this Github organization was born. [Jeremy Wong](https://twitter.com/jermspeaks) has been running most of this organization. [Kelly Yamamoto](https://twitter.com/minedamnesia) suggests us to follow the organization's [[Code of Conduct]].
