Resources for DBC Graduates

Welcome ye all who have found the Post-DBC Resources guide. This section are resources to get you started for your Post-DBC life. We're using the Wiki instead of contributing to the Repository. That way, anyone who joins can make changes without having to do commits (we're not official here).
